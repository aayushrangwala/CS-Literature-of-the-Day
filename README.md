# CS Literature of the Day

I like computer science. That's why I'm [tweeting](https://twitter.com/tyler_treat) a new piece of CS literature every day with the hashtag #CSLOTD. Some people don't like newfangled social media, so I'm maintaining a curated repository of the material here.

## What?

Each day, I will tweet a link to an interesting piece of CS literature. I use "literature" to mean research paper, white paper, talk, slide deck, blog post, or really any thought-provoking content which is in the realm of computer science.

Licensing and related legalese is confusing and boring. This repo doesn't host any material, it just provides links to them. If you find a broken link, file an issue or open a PR.

## Prior Art

[Papers We Love](http://paperswelove.org/) is an awesome community with a collection of cool academic papers. Check them out.

## Contributing

If you know of an interesting piece of CS literature which you think should be included, feel free to submit it via a PR. Just add the title and link to backlog.md on a new line. I'm still not sure if this makes the most sense for managing contributions. Maybe just creating an issue with the link is better? I'm always open to suggestions.

## Disclaimer

I'm doing this because I'm enthusiastic about CS. I reserve the right to stop doing it at any time or miss days for whatever reason. I also tweet things that *I* think are interesting. If you don't find them interesting, that's your problem. As such, I reserve the right to reject submissions if I don't find them interesting enough to include.
